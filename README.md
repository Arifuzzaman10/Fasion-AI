News: Key releases from Kolors, including the Kolors-Virtual-Try-On demo, Pose ControlNet, and Dreambooth-LoRA code. Kolors’ model advancements, such as IP-Adapter and ControlNet, continue enhancing text-to-image synthesis.

Open-source Plan: Detailed components, training scripts, and model variants, including Kolors and ControlNet’s latest functionalities.

Introduction: Kolors, a diffusion model developed for high-quality bilingual (Chinese and English) text-to-image generation, builds upon billions of image-text pairs for exceptional semantic and aesthetic accuracy.

Evaluation: Kolors excels in both human and machine evaluations, achieving leading satisfaction scores and impressive machine ratings across dimensions.

Visualization: Extensive visual cases including high-quality portraiture, Chinese elements, and complex semantic understanding.

Usage: Installation requirements, repository access, and model inference steps. Compatibility includes Python, PyTorch, CUDA, and guidance for Diffusers integration.

License: The model is open for academic use with commercial licensing protocols. Respect for security and ethical standards is emphasized.
